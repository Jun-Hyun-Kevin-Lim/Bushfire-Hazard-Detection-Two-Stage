# Bushfire-Hazard-Detection-Two-Stage
Two-stage bushfire hazard detection system in Python/Colab using a Kaggle forest fire–smoke–non-fire dataset; handcrafted LBP/HOG/colour features with linear SVM (plus kNN baseline), PR/ROC evaluation, and a deployable hazard-filter → fire-vs-smoke pipeline for early warning.
